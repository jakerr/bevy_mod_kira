# Bevy Mod Kira
Bevy Mod Kira is a plugin that integrates the Kira audio library with the Bevy game engine.

# Motivation
The purpose of this plugin is to provide seamless integration of Kira audio library with Bevy game engine. Bevy Mod Kira is designed to be a minimal wrapper so that all of Kira's features can be used directly. The guiding design principal is that any feature supported by Kira should be accessible through this plugin (though it's not quite there yet.)

# Status
